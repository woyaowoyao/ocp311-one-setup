# Include this to delete the current test host container.

# In order to recover from test exceptions, this cleanup is expected to
# be done in an "always:" task on the same block as the test task(s). So
# it happens in a task "on" the host being tested. In order to delete the
# host's container, the task uses its own hostname (which is same as the
# container name) but delegates the docker action to localhost.

    # so handlers don't break the test by trying to run after teardown:
